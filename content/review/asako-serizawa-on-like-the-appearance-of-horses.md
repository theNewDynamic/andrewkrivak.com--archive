Andrew Krivak's Homeric novel is at once intimate and sweeping, expanding an epic story set into motion in _The Sojourn_. Tenderly attentive to all that is given and taken by war, _Like the Appearance of Horses_ is a graceful, heroic accomplishment that speaks to the costs of duty when violence is as constant as the Pennsylvania mountains that anchor and separate this indelible family we've come to know so personally.
