description: "Oh my this novel is so gorgeous and moving. About matters of the heart, about war’s impact on not just nations but individuals over generations. About how families are knitted together and how they survive with heartbreak just around the corner. How solace can be found in nature…This is one of those rare novels that quietly will not leave the reader alone and untouched. Just beautiful."
